# TeenSuicide

According to Center of Disease Control (CDC), the rate of teen suicide has been climbing ever since 2009 and has only been surpassed by accidental injury in 2017. More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease, combined. With the dramatic increase of suicide during adolescent, teen suicide is an unfortunate result of more pressure and stresses from the modern world.
